# snap

:boohooa:

![](snap.gif)

takes an image and thanos snaps it

works best with images that have a lot of transparent pixels, like emoji

for simpler images, resultant gifs should be small enough to fit into a discord animated emote (< 256 kB)

current issues:
- transparency isn't exact, so there might be random transparent pixels in the first frame; this doesn't happen if there are transparent pixels in the original image, or if there is only a small amount of colors in the image
- doesn't work on some browsers? (brave)

in the future:
- add controls so the particles change behavior to your liking
